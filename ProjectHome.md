The main idea of project is to create a web application which will provide a service of embedding map images. So each webmaster/developer will be able to easily put any map on his webpage. The map is going to be embedded in HTML code just like an usual image. Maps can be presented as an image in different formats (jpeg, gif etc). Also the type of map will be configurable, so by changing url parameter webmaster will be able to choose if he wants to display a cycle map or a skiing map.
